## Dev Tools

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Opinionated code formatter that ensures formatting is always consistent. It is set to run during commit (`package.json#husky`), so it does the work behind the scenes if you don't want to worry about it.
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) (Optional) - Alternative package manager to npm. In my experience, it handles package version locking better and is faster. Using `yarn` instead of `npm install` will read the `yarn.lock` file and use package versions from there.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Adds types and other safety features to JavaScript. Added bonus of allowing the use of newer JavaScript features in Node and significantly improving development experience (better documentation on hover, "find all references", safer auto refactors, etc).
- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) - Automatically configures indent spacing, end of line character, and other common settings for editors.
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - Similar to TypeScript. Tells you when you're being stupid.
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Configuration loader. Instead of hardcoding configuration values (database passwords, tokens, etc) it loads them from `.env` in the root of the project.
- [log4js](https://github.com/log4js-node/log4js-node) - Logging can get messy. This adds a layer of configurability to it (driven by `LOG_LEVEL`) so you can tweak the amount of output without modifying code. Can also have it output to multiple, different locations (files, log aggregators, console, ...).
- [knex](http://knexjs.org/) - SQL Builder that adds safety and TypeScript support so you don't have to worry about it.
